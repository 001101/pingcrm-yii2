# Ping CRM on Yii 2

A Yii 2 demo application to illustrate how [Inertia.js](https://inertiajs.com) works.

With Inertia you are able to build single-page apps using classic server-side routing and controllers, without building an API. 

This application is a port of the original [Ping CRM written in Laravel](https://github.com/inertiajs/pingcrm) and based on the [Yii 2 Basic Project Template](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2-app-basic).
